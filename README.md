# Computational Conformal Geometry Homework

This C++ project framework is used to help students to implement geometric algorithms.

## System

The code has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOS 10.15.5, if there is any problem, please let me know.

## Directory Structure

``` txt
cutgraph            -- Folder for cut graph algorithm.
harmonic_map        -- Folder for harmonic map algorithm. 
data                -- Some models.
CMakeLists.txt      -- CMake configuration file.
resources           -- Some resources needed.
3rdparty            -- MeshLib and freeglut libraries.
```

## Configuration

Follow the instruction in the README.md of each algorithm folder.
